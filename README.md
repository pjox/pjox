### Hi there 👋

I'm a researcher at the [Speech and Language Technology Team](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) at [DFKI GmbH](https://www.dfki.de/en/web) Berlin.

I am interested in [large corpora](https://oscar-corpus.com) for training [language models](https://camembert-model.fr), specially for under resourced languages and historical languages. I am interested in tasks such as Name Entity Recognition (NER), Dependency Parsing and Part-of-Speech tagging, Machine Translation and Document structuration.

I love coffee ☕️, cookies 🍪 and maths.
