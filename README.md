### Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science woking in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for historical documents at [Sorbonne Université](https://sorbonne-universite.fr/en) and at the [ALMAnaCH research team](https://team.inria.fr/almanach/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/).

I am interested in [large corpora](https://oscar-corpus.com) for training [language models](https://camembert-model.fr), specially for under resourced languages and historical languages. I am interested in tasks such as Name Entity Recognition (NER), Dependency Parsing and Part-of-Speech tagging, Machine Translation and Document structuration.

I love coffee ☕️, cookies 🍪 and maths.
